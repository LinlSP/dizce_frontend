# Dizce [Frontend]

Dizce is a project thought as a website of a company, which has the objective of helping people access information in other languages without them needing to learn them, and main functionality being a page where users can find educative websites from and in three different languages (German, English, Spanish) with their respective descriptions and links.

This exact part of the project includes only the frontend in development state. For the production 'build', backend (server) and therefore complete App, please [click here](https://github.com/LinlSP/dizce).

## Main Technology

React

## Original Idea

The original idea was to implement up to three functionalities:

1. Free: Selection of the most relevant free educative websites in any of the three languages of Dizce.
2. Shop [abandoned]: Shop of important papers of worldwide concerns and language plugins for already existing educative software, as well as offline access to educative sites (cloned).
3. Personalized [abandoned]: Form to contact the company in case of inquiries and more personalized requests.

But to implement the last two only made sense if this was going to be a real business. So to prevent over engineering this project I decided that it was fine as it is now.

## Code style

**Language**: English

The code is not 100% polished and there are many things that could have been done better (like to make the modal more reusable), however for the purposes of this project they weren't strictly necessary, plus I've made sure that the code is fully understandable.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Dizce [frontend].

```bash
npm install
```
